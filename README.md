# DRFVue
A CRUD Python Rest Framework with Vue application rotating around a product model.
## Summary
Project is composed of the following:
- Building the REST API: You will create a simple REST API around one model (Product) with DRF and learn how to add pagination to your APIs.
- Creating the Service to Consume the API: You will create the class that interfaces with your API using Axios.
- Creating the Front End Views: You will create different views and routes for the Vue application and see how you can protect some routes from non authenticated users.
- Getting Ready for Production: Finally you'll prepare your app for production by tweaking some settings in Vue and Django parts.

## Other ideas:
Ideas are welcome to scale the project.
